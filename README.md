# selective-fixed-labels
Automated pipeline for selective FIXED labels in ProteinMPNN motif design. Analyzes protein contacts, parses RFdiffusion TRB files, and generates scripts that fix only critical residues instead of entire motif regions. Improves design flexibility and success rates in complex scaffolding projects.
